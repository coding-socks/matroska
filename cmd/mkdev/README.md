## Introduction

`mkdev` stands for "Matroska Development". The name **differs** from the extension naming used for Matroska files. The most used extensions are `mkv` "Matroska Video", `mka` "Matroska Audio", and `mks` "Matroska Subtitle".

This library builds on top of multiple incomplete and complete documents. It was created for investigating other file formats.

The implementations MAY change and they use "internal" packages.
